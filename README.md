You'll know the install is complete/done when you see a node_modules folder in your working directory

npm start

```

```

It is easier to use nvm for node installation. It allows you to quickly install and use different versions of node via the command line

It is available on [Linux/Mac](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and [Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)

You can find the setup file in the releases section and install it

To install node v14 you just need to execute 2 comands

nvm install 14
nvm use 14
```

***nvm basics**
```
nvm list - show list of all downloaded versions of node
nvm uninstall v14.16.1 -uninstalls specific version
```

***How React Works**

React allows you to create re-usable and reactive components consisting of HTML & CSS and JavaScript

Why Components? Reusability and Separation of concerns
